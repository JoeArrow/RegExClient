# **RegEx Client**

**RegEx Client** is designed to allow the user to test *Regular Expressions*.<br/>
Regular Expressions and the text used to test them can be saved and<br/>
reloaded later.<br/><br/>

Right-Clicking on the 'Text to Test' will toggle whether the Regular Expression is applied or not.<br/>
Editing the text to test is much easier when the RegEx is not being applied.<br/><br/>
Once a complicated RegEx is perfected, it can be saved (along with the text being used to test it).<br/>
This will come in handy for recalling it later and possibly revising it.<br/><br/>

As the Regular Expression is typed in, it is applied to the Text to Test.<br/>
Matches are highlighted in alternating colors.<br/><br/>

The test text can be <span style='color:red'>zoomed</span> into and out of by using<br/>
**CTRL - Plus (+)**<br/>and<br/>**CTRL - Minus (-)**<br/> 
(For those of us with aging eyes 😎)<br/><br/> 
This is a *work in progress*. (But its coming along nicely...)
